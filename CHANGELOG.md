# Changelog

All notable changes to Assignee.ai are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Both `@assignee/cli` and `@assignee/mcp-server` packages are currently
`private: true` — nothing is published to npm yet. `0.1.0` below is the
internal development baseline; the first published version (`0.2.0` or
later) will land when the project is ready for public release.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Root legal and community files: `LICENSE` (MIT), `SECURITY.md`,
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` (Contributor Covenant 2.1),
  and this `CHANGELOG.md` (Story 50-8).
- Exit-code contract unified across `docs/commands.md` and
  `docs/troubleshooting.md`; CLI integration test
  (`apps/cli/src/__tests__/exit-codes.test.ts`) asserts the actual
  emitted exit code for each error class.
- Wired exit code `10` for policy/safety aborts (`UserCancelledError`,
  `StateGuardError`, `MissingRequiredFieldsError`) and exit code `11`
  for MCP startup failures (`ErrorCode.MCP_STARTUP_FAILED`). Previously
  all errors emitted exit `1`.

### Changed

- `docs/index.md` re-categorises `docs/commands.md` from How-to to
  Reference — it is lookup-style information, not a task recipe.
- `docs/explanation/invariants.md` no longer references the
  maintainer's local auto-memory directory path; filenames remain as
  internal grep hints.
- `README.md` disclaimer updated to note the project is now MIT-licensed
  (source available) even though `npm publish` is deferred.

### Removed

- `docs/stories/` — relocated to
  `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/_archive/done-stories/`.
- `docs/mcp-intelligence-audit.md` — relocated to
  `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/_archive/`.

## [0.1.0] — YYYY-MM-DD

Initial internal development baseline. Not published to npm.

### Added

- `assignee` CLI with 13 commands: `plan`, `apply`, `destroy`,
  `drift`, `reconcile`, `list`, `status`, `optimize`, `init`, `setup`,
  `doctor`, `completions`, `version`.
- `@assignee/mcp-server` exposing the pipeline to AI coding agents
  (Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf) via MCP.
- `@assignee/core` shared library: ports, schemas, destroy strategies,
  checkpoint store, pricing, testing utilities.
- `@assignee/best-practices` — 186 YAML best-practice rules with
  SHA-256 manifest integrity.
- Support for 37 AWS resource types, 9 compound architecture patterns.
- 13-node LangGraph pipeline: intent_parser → schema_fetcher →
  option_elicitor → compound_dispatcher → plan_generator → bp_evaluator
  → fix_applicator → preflight_guard → human_approval →
  resource_provisioner → status_poller → result_formatter →
  advice_generator.
- AWS MCP server integrations: pricing, documentation, IAM,
  well-architected-security, billing-cost-management.
- Drift detection, reconcile, cost-rightsizing optimizer (Graviton
  swap recommendations).
